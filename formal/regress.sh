#   formal/regress.sh <finding>          one row, keyed by SWEEP.tsv (see --list)
#   formal/regress.sh --all              every row in mutations/SWEEP.tsv
#   formal/regress.sh --list             show the manifest
#   formal/regress.sh --replay ...       build each worktree from the HEAD each
#                                        row was RECORDED at, not current HEAD
#
# For each row: detached worktree, reintroduce the defect (git revert, or
# mutations/<finding>.patch), run the module, and require the recorded outcome.
#
# TWO INVERSIONS make this different from run.sh, and both matter:
#
#   1. run.sh FAILING is success here. A defect that reddens nothing is the bug.
#      Never trust run.sh's exit code; parse the verdict block.
#
#   2. The CONTROL is checked first. A property that is already red at unmutated
#      HEAD proves nothing when it is red under mutation, for a reason unrelated
#      to the mutated defect. --all verifies the unmutated tree is clean before
#      it trusts a single row.
#
#      NOTE ON THE WORD: this is the CONTROL run, not the "baseline". In this
#      project `baseline` means the pre-verification RTL -- see
#      formal/baseline/MANIFEST.tsv, which is a different measurement entirely.
#
# TWO MANIFEST COLUMNS THIS SCRIPT ACTS ON:
#
#   class     rtl | harness. Most rows mutate the DESIGN and ask whether the
#             instrument still sees the defect. A harness row mutates the
#             INSTRUMENT and asks whether it is load-bearing at all. The script
#             does not branch on this -- it reports it, because those are
#             different questions and a manifest that cannot tell them apart
#             cannot say which it answered.
#
#   head      the HEAD each row's outcome was MEASURED at. NOT the "baseline" --
#             that word is taken: formal/baseline/MANIFEST.tsv records the
#             pre-verification RTL, a different measurement.
#
#             The sweep runs at current HEAD by design: "does the suite STILL
#             catch this" is a question about the code as it stands, not a
#             historical replay. So when HEAD has moved past a row's recorded
#             one this script WARNS and still runs -- a changed outcome is then
#             a result to investigate rather than drift silently attributed to
#             the mutation. --replay rebuilds at the recorded HEAD instead,
#             which is what makes the numbers reproducible rather than dated.
#
# Requires FORMAL_BACKEND naming a real tool's backend (formal/backend/README.md).
# stub and dryrun are refused: every row would "pass" against nothing. One run per
# module directory at a time: concurrent runs on the same formal/fv_proj/<module>
# collide on the tool's scratch.
