#
# GATED vs UNGATED
#
# Some proofs hold only under an assumption that papers over a known, recorded
# defect - ASSUME_FILL_FIRST and ASSUME_ENQ_WHEN_WREADY are the two examples in
# this suite. The default (gated) run applies them, so work on everything else
# can continue.
# --ungated drops them and reproduces the defects.
#
# Ungated is NOT "expect failure". Each config lists exactly which properties are
# supposed to break (expect_cex_ungated), so the run still exits 0 if and only if
# precisely those fail. A defect that gets FIXED therefore fails the ungated
# run - "expected cex that did NOT fire" - which is the prompt to retire the
# assumption. That makes the shortcomings a regression test rather than a
# footnote.
#
# Everything a run generates - tool scratch, console log, property summary -
# goes to formal/fv_proj/<module>[_selftest][_ungated]/ and nowhere else, so
# the whole lot is one gitignored tree and one directory to delete.
#
# Runs from any working directory: paths resolve against the repo root.
#
# BACKEND
#
# No tool is named in this repository. FORMAL_BACKEND selects one of
# formal/backend/<name>.sh; see formal/backend/README.md. The licence-free
# `stub` and `dryrun` backends ship with the repo, so --all is runnable
# anywhere; a backend for a real tool is written locally and never committed.
