# Exercises formal/verdict.tcl's decisions against the licence-free `stub`
# backend, so the pass/fail/exit-code logic is validated anywhere. Invoked by
# formal/tools/smoke.sh.

# What this does NOT validate: the real property-table filter syntax and status
# spellings, which vary by release and can only be confirmed against the tool.
# That is the backend's half of the contract -- see formal/backend/README.md.
