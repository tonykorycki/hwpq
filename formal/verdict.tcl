# formal/verdict.tcl - shared prove / classify / report / exit tail.
#
# Sourced by formal/drive.tcl after the design is analyzed, elaborated, clocked
# and reset. This file only knows how to prove, classify the result, and decide
# pass/fail. Every tool-specific operation goes through the backend:: contract
#
# CALLER CONTRACT:
#   HWPQ_MODULE          module name, used in the verdict banner.        REQUIRED
#   HWPQ_OUTDIR (env)    where run.sh wants artifacts; defaults to formal/
#   HWPQ_ALLOW_BOUNDED   1 = accept bounded_proven asserts.            Default 0
#   HWPQ_EXPECT_CEX      list of assert leaf-names that are SUPPOSED to fail.
#                        A listed property that proves is a FAILURE; one that
#                        produces a cex is a PASS.                     Default {}
#
# VERSION SENSITIVITY:
#   Property-table filter syntax and status spellings shift between tool
#   releases. That variation is the backend's problem, not this file's: every
#   query here goes through backend::property_list, and a failure to QUERY is a
#   hard error (exit 2), never "nothing found". If a query errors, the backend
#   is the thing to fix.

# it means the TOOL resolves the drivers, and what it resolves to is not what
# the design computes. Writes stop being reliably observable - a write to
# address 0 need not be there on the next cycle - and every memory-dependent
# property is then decided against contents the tool was free to invent.

# The gate runs BEFORE proving. A run against a resolved-driver model does not
